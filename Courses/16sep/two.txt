'Here''s a breakdown of how to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions, along with explanations and examples:

**Understanding the Concepts**

* **Infix Notation:** The standard way we write mathematical expressions, with operators between operands (e.g., 2 + 3).
* **Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation):** Operators appear *after* their operands (e.g., 2 3 +).
* **The Goal:** Convert an infix expression to its equivalent postfix representation, preserving the order of operations.

**Conversion Algorithm (Using a Stack)**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty stack to store operators.
2. **Scan the Infix Expression:** Process the expression from left to right.
3. **For Each Token:**
   * **Operand:**  Append the operand to the output string.
   * **Operator:**
     * While the stack is not empty *and* the current operator has lower or equal precedence to the top operator on the stack:
       * Pop the operator from the stack and append it to the output string.
     * Push the current operator onto the stack.
4. **Empty the Stack:** Pop any remaining operators from the stack and append them to the output string.

**Precedence Rules (Commonly Used)**

* **Highest Precedence:**  *, /
* **Lower Precedence:** +, -
* **Lowest Precedence:** Parentheses (used to override precedence)

**Example: (5 + 2) * 3**

1. **Initialize:** Stack = []
2. **Scan:**
   * **5:** Output = "5"
   * **+:** Stack = ["+"]
   * **2:** Output = "5 2"
   * **):** Pop "+" from the stack and append it to the output: Output = "5 2 +" 
   * ***:** Stack = ["*"]
   * **3:** Output = "5 2 + 3"
3. **Empty Stack:** Pop "*" from the stack: Output = "5 2 + 3 *"

**Result:** The postfix expression is **5 2 + 3 ***

**Key Points:**

* **Parentheses:** When you encounter a left parenthesis "(", push it onto the stack. When you encounter a right parenthesis ")", pop operators from the stack until you find the matching left parenthesis (and discard both).
* **Associativity:**  Most operators are left-associative (e.g., 2 - 3 - 4 is calculated as ((2 - 3) - 4)).  This means that operators of equal precedence are processed from left to right.

**Example Code (Python):**

```python
def infix_to_postfix(infix):
  """Converts an infix expression to postfix."""
  output = []
  operator_stack = []
  precedence = {''+'': 1, ''-'': 1, ''*'': 2, ''/'': 2, ''^'': 3}

  for token in infix:
    if token.isalnum():
      output.append(token)
    elif token == ''('':
      operator_stack.append(token)
    elif token == '')'':
      while operator_stack and operator_stack[-1] != ''('':
        output.append(operator_stack.pop())
      operator_stack.pop()  # Remove the matching ''(''
    else:  # It''s an operator
      while operator_stack and operator_stack[-1] != ''('' and \
              precedence[token] <= precedence[operator_stack[-1]]:
        output.append(operator_stack.pop())
      operator_stack.append(token)

  while operator_stack:
    output.append(operator_stack.pop())

  return '' ''.join(output)

# Example usage
infix_expression = "(5 + 2) * 3"
postfix_expression = infix_to_postfix(infix_expression)
print(f"Infix: {infix_expression}")
print(f"Postfix: {postfix_expression}") 
```
